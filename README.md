I saw [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/eibmnj/nebula_in_champagne/) and wanted to do some analysis.
My *guess* is that the frequency of the bubbles and frequency of the (tiny) wave going out from the bubbles has some interesting relationship.

The plan is to

1. Model the bubbles's movements
2. Find the frequency of rotation of the descent of the bubbles
3. Vary parameters/perform bifurcation analysis to find where they're changing direction.
